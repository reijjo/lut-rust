Backend Application

In the backend application, the task is to create a project where the student can use an HTML form to create data, view the saved data at a specific route, and view more details on specific data, such as a course list or e-commerce products.

Points are earned for various routes, such as:

    Creation of data
    Deleting data
    Displaying data
    Use of custom types (structs)

This project could be something like a course listing or an e-commerce site using multiple routes and operations.
