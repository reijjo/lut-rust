<em>During week 3, the main goal is to learn how Rust handles the OOP paradigm. There is only one practice for the week, but it expands gradually. This means that newer versions with more features will generate more points for students.<br><br></em><br>

<h3>Task 1</h3>List all the possible countries<strong> shown above,</strong> ask the user to enter information and print the country information. Make a module called "game" with a Country.rs file and a mod.rs file. Make the Country.rs file public in mod.rs. In Country.rs, create a structure called Country with the attributes name, population, army_size, conquered_countries as a string vector, and is_conquered as a Boolean type. Use i64 for number attributes, String type for strings, and vector with String type for strings.<br><br>Create methods <em>new</em>, <em>get_name()</em>, <em>get_population()</em> and <em>get_army_size</em> in the struct. <em>get</em> functions return their respective attribute values ​​as immutable references. The <em>new </em>function creates an instance of Country for these fields with the <strong>given values,</strong> and returns this instance with the help of <em>self</em>.<br><br><br>In the Main function, import the Country type and, based on the user's input, create a new Country with the <strong>information below</strong> and print the country, the population and the entire army according to the example run.<br><img src="data/kuva.png" alt="" role="presentation" class="img-fluid"><br><br>Example run Finland:<br><pre>| 1) Finland | 2) Sweden | 3) Norway | 4) Denmark |<br>Choose your country: <br><strong>1</strong><br>Country: Finland<br>Population: 5600000<br>Army size: 900000</pre><br>Example run Sweden:<br><pre>| 1) Finland | 2) Sweden | 3) Norway | 4) Denmark |<br>Choose your country: <br><strong>2</strong><br>Country: Sweden<br>Population: 10000000<br>Army size: 200000</pre><br><h3><span lang="EN-US">Task 2</span></h3>&nbsp;Add the Player.rs file to the game folder. Add a structure named "Player" and implement <em>new</em>, <em>inspect </em>and <em>get_country</em> methods for the Player class. The Player structure has the Country selected by the player, and the function <em>new </em>instantiates the Player object with the given country. The inspection function prints the same information as before, but with added print lines. For example, you can use printing as below:<br><br><pre> println!("Name: {}", self.country.get_name())</pre><br><em>get_country</em>-funktio palauttaa muuttuvan viittauksen pelaajan valitsemaan maahan.<br><br>In the main function, ask the user to select their country. Based on the selection, make a new Player instance with the selected country as an instance of the Country class and the same Country data as before.<br><br>Ask the user if they want to check their nation. Use the Player check function if the user enters "y" and if the user enters "n" print as in the example run.<br><br>Example run Finland:<br><pre>| 1) Finland | 2) Sweden | 3) Norway | 4) Denmark |<br>Choose your country:<br><strong>1</strong><br>| Inspection on your own nation? | y = yes | n = no |<br><strong>y</strong><br>An inspection has been completed..<br>Country information:<br>Name: Finland<br>Population: 5600000<br>Army size: 900000<br><br></pre>Example run Norway, no inspection:<br><pre>| 1) Finland | 2) Sweden | 3) Norway | 4) Denmark |<br>Choose your country: <br><strong>3</strong><br>| Inspection on your own nation? | y = yes | n = no |<br><strong>n</strong><br>The leader is confident. No inspection needed.<br><br></pre><p><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><h3><span lang="EN-US"></span></h3><h3><span lang="EN-US">Task 3</span></h3>After the inspection part, the user can spy on the land. You cannot spy on your own nation. If you are spying on another nation, print the country information as before. When spying, you print the information of the country being spied on.<br><br>Create a spy function as a method in the Player class of the Player.rs file.<br><br>Edit the main.rs file to loop until Player breaks the loop by entering 0 . In the loop, ask if the user wants to do an inspection and then ask if he wants to spy. Give the option to exit the program in the spying section.<br><br>Modify the original implementation to be more modular. Add the GameMap.rs file to the game folder. In this file, make a structure called GameMap with an attribute of countries of type Country vector. Implement <em>new</em>, <em>list_countries </em>and <em>get_country_by_index </em>functions in GameMap. In the new function, create all four countries with their data as Country type and store them in the country attribute of the GameMap struct. The list_countries function lists all countries and their indices:<br>"1) Finland" etc.<br><br>The <em>get_country_by_index </em>function returns a variable country type for the given country in the GameMap attribute's countries.<br><br>At the beginning of main.rs, implement the GameMap structure and add all the countries to it. For the sake of modularity, use this function when it is necessary to print the country information to the user with the corresponding indexes.<br><br>Remember to add the necessary additions to the mod.rs file in the game folder.<br><br>Remember to add the necessary additions to the mod.rs file in the game folder.<br><br><p><span lang="EN-US">Example run:</span></p><pre><span lang="EN-US">| 1) Finland | 2) Sweden | 3) Norway | 4) Denmark |<br>Choose your country: <br><strong>4</strong><br>| Inspection on your own nation? | y = yes | n = no |<br><strong>y</strong><br>An inspection has been completed..<br>Country information:<br>Name: Denmark<br>Population: 6000000<br>Army size: 50000<br>| 1) Spy on a country | 0) Exit program |<br><strong>1</strong><br>1) Denmark<br>2) Finland<br>3) Norway<br>4) Sweden<br><strong>1</strong><br>You can't spy on your own nation!<br>| Inspection on your own nation? | y = yes | n = no |<br><strong>y</strong><br>An inspection has been completed..<br>Country information:<br>Name: Denmark<br>Population: 6000000<br>Army size: 50000<br>| 1) Spy on a country | 0) Exit program |<br><strong>1</strong><br>1) Denmark<br>2) Finland<br>3) Norway<br>4) Sweden<br><strong>3</strong><br>Espionage successful.<br>Country information:<br>Name: Norway<br>Population: 5500000<br>Army size: 100000<br>| Inspection on your own nation? | y = yes | n = no |<br><strong>n</strong><br>The leader is confident.
