<h4 dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Returning the assignments</h4>Weekly programming assignments are returned as a zipped folder to Codegrade. Use the zip command to compress the project folder. The folder can be returned as a zip to Codegrade. If you have problems running your program in Codegrade, delete the "target" folder, as this folder contains your compiled Rust code and can take up a lot of space in your project folder in week 5 and cause problems with running files. The target folder is created every time you compile or run the contents of your program with the <em>cargo build</em> or <em>cargo run </em>commands. The folder can be found inside your project folder.<br><br><h4>Evaluation of the assignments</h4>Weekly coding assignments are automatically graded in Codegrade. Codegrade shows which tests you passed, what error codes you received if you failed the test, and how many points you received for that assignment. These points are automatically transferred to Moodle.<br><br><br><h4>Tips regarding returning the assignments</h4>Try running your program until it looks the same as the example run in the weekly task description. Review the errors that occur during compilation given by your command prompt, and note that the output of the example run should be the same in your program.<h4><br></h4><p><br></p>
